Creating a Power Automate flow using AI Builder to process a README file for a GitHub repository involves several steps. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide to set it up:

Prerequisites

Power Automate Account: Ensure you have access to Power Automate.

GitHub Account: Access to the repository from which you want to process the README file.

AI Builder Credits: Ensure you have the necessary AI Builder credits for text processing.

Basic Understanding of Power Automate and AI Builder.

Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Access Power Automate and AI Builder

Sign in to Power Automate.

Navigate to AI Builder:

Go to AI Builder in the left-hand menu.

Select Explore.

Step 2: Create an AI Model

Select a Model Type:

Choose Text recognition or Document processing based on your needs.

Configure the Model:

Follow the steps to configure your model.

Upload sample README files to train the model.

Define the key data points you want to extract (e.g., headers, sections, links).

Train the Model:

Train the model with your sample data.

Validate the model to ensure it accurately processes the README content.

Step 3: Create a Power Automate Flow

Start a New Flow:

Go to My Flows and select New Flow.

Choose Automated Flow if you want it to trigger automatically or Instant Flow for manual triggering.

Add Trigger:

Choose a trigger. For example, When a new file is created in a folder (from OneDrive, SharePoint, etc.).

Add Actions:

Get File Content: Add an action to retrieve the README file content.

AI Builder: Add the AI Builder action to process the document.

Select your trained AI Builder model.

Map the content from the file to the input of the AI Builder model.

Parse and Use Extracted Data:

Use subsequent actions to handle the extracted data.

For example, you can use Parse JSON to work with the structured data returned by AI Builder.
You might want to send the extracted data to another service, like storing it in a database or sending an email summary.

Step 4: Handle the Data
Store Data:

Add actions to store the extracted data in a preferred location (e.g., SQL Database, SharePoint List, etc.).

Notifications:

Add email or Teams notifications to alert relevant stakeholders about the processed README file.

Custom Actions:

Depending on your needs, you might add more custom actions to manipulate or display the data as required.

Example Flow Configuration

Trigger: When a file is created in a OneDrive folder.
Action 1: Get file content.
Action 2: Use AI Builder to process the file content.
Action 3: Parse the JSON response from AI Builder.
Action 4: Store the parsed data in a SharePoint List.
Action 5: Send an email notification with the extracted information.

Best Practices
Model Training: Ensure your AI Builder model is trained with diverse samples of README files to improve accuracy.
Error Handling: Implement error handling steps in your flow to manage any issues during processing.
Testing: Thoroughly test the flow with different README files to ensure it handles various formats correctly.

Conclusion

Using Power Automate and AI Builder to process GitHub README files can automate and streamline the extraction of key information, making it easier to manage and utilize README content. By following the steps outlined above, you can create a robust automation flow tailored to your specific needs.
